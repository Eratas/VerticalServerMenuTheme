- Demonstration of the total online servers

- Although I spent a lot of time and wasted a lot of nerves trying to catch the effects of pressing and dragging me will not return, but I hope my work someone useful.
You have to understand that the plugin has bugs that I have not noticed, although I corrected them more than a dozen, in the case of such can write in the comments.
The plugin itself, I made in November, but as the plugin to moderation, I decided to publish it now, as I am not sure of the date of official publication, which would allow to automatically update the plugin.
In the future I want to make visible not only the number of participants, but also the current online server, but with this there are technical difficulties.
